Round 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence  
Theme: “Connect What Matters — For the User Who Matters”  
Challenge Brief (For Participants)  
You will build a system that acts as an intelligent document analyst, extracting 
and prioritizing the most relevant sections from a collection of documents based 
on a specific persona and their job-to-be-done.  
Input Specification  
2. Document Collection: 3-10 related PDFs Persona Definition: Role 
description with specific expertise and focus areas  
3. Job-to-be-Done: Concrete task the persona needs to accomplish  
Document collection, persona and job-to-be-done can be very diverse. So, the 
solution that teams need to build needs to be generic to generalize to this 
variety.   
• Documents can be from any domain (Example: Research papers, 
school/college books, financial reports, news articles etc.)  
• Persona can again be very diverse (Example: Researcher, Student, 
Salesperson, Journalist, Entrepreneur etc)  
• Job-to-be-done: This will be related to the persona (Example: 
Provide a literature review for a given topic and available research 
papers, What should I study for Organic Chemistry given the 
chemistry documents, Summarize the financials of corporation xyz 
given the detailed year end financial reports etc.)  
Sample Test Cases  
Test Case 1: Academic Research  
• Documents: 4 research papers on "Graph Neural Networks for 
Drug Discovery"  
• Persona: PhD Researcher in Computational Biology  
• Job: "Prepare a comprehensive literature review focusing on 
methodologies, datasets, and performance benchmarks"  
Test Case 2: Business Analysis  
• Documents: 3 annual reports from competing tech companies 
(2022-2024)  
• Persona: Investment Analyst  
• Job: "Analyze revenue trends, R&D investments, and market 
positioning strategies"  
Test Case 3: Educational Content  
• Documents: 5 chapters from organic chemistry textbooks  
• Persona: Undergraduate Chemistry Student  
• Job: "Identify key concepts and mechanisms for exam preparation 
on reaction kinetics"
