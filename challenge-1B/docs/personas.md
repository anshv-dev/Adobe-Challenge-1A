## Relevance Scoring Algorithm

The persona-driven relevance scoring uses a multi-dimensional approach:

```
relevance_score = (
    keyword_frequency * 0.4 +
    context_relevance * 0.3 +
    section_importance * 0.2 +
    persona_specificity * 0.1
)
```

### Scoring Components

1. **Keyword Frequency (40%)**: Direct matches with persona keywords
2. **Context Relevance (30%)**: Semantic analysis of surrounding content
3. **Section Importance (20%)**: Document structure and heading analysis
4. **Persona Specificity (10%)**: Domain-specific terminology weights
