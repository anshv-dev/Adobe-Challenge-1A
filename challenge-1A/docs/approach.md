# Adobe Hackathon Challenge 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Approach Explanation

### Overview

Our solution implements an intelligent document analyst that extracts and prioritizes the most relevant sections from a collection of PDF documents based on a specific persona and their job-to-be-done. The system uses advanced text analysis, relevance scoring, and content extraction techniques to deliver persona-specific insights.

### Methodology

#### 1. **Document Processing Pipeline**
- **PDF Parsing**: Uses PyMuPDF (fitz) for efficient PDF text extraction and formatting analysis
- **Section Detection**: Identifies potential section titles using font size, bold formatting, and structural patterns
- **Content Extraction**: Extracts contextual content around identified section titles
- **Multi-document Processing**: Handles 3-10 documents simultaneously with optimized performance

#### 2. **Persona-Aware Relevance Scoring**
- **Keyword Mapping**: Pre-defined keyword sets for different persona types (researcher, student, analyst, food contractor, etc.)
- **Job-Specific Analysis**: Dynamically extracts relevant terms from job descriptions
- **Weighted Scoring System**: 
  - Persona keywords: 2.0 points
  - Job-specific keywords: 3.0 points  
  - Dietary/domain-specific terms: 4.0 points
  - Formatting importance (bold, large font): 1.0-1.5 points

#### 3. **Section Prioritization Algorithm**
- **Multi-factor Ranking**: Combines content relevance, formatting importance, and contextual signals
- **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Adapts to document collection characteristics
- **Top-K Selection**: Returns the 5 most relevant sections ranked by importance

#### 4. **Content Refinement**
- **Contextual Extraction**: Retrieves detailed content around high-priority sections
- **Length Optimization**: Balances comprehensiveness with readability (500 char limit)
- **Quality Filtering**: Removes irrelevant text patterns and noise

### Technical Implementation

#### Core Components:
1. **PersonaDrivenDocumentAnalyst**: Main analysis engine
2. **Section Detection**: Advanced text parsing with formatting analysis  
3. **Relevance Scoring**: Multi-dimensional scoring algorithm
4. **Content Extraction**: Context-aware text retrieval

#### Performance Optimizations:
- **Efficient PDF Processing**: Streams text extraction without full document conversion
- **Memory Management**: Processes documents individually to minimize memory footprint
- **CPU-Only Architecture**: No GPU dependencies, runs efficiently on standard hardware
- **Offline Operation**: Zero network dependencies for complete offline functionality

### Key Features

- **Generic Domain Support**: Handles documents from any domain (research, business, education, food, etc.)
- **Flexible Persona Types**: Supports diverse personas with customizable keyword sets
- **Scalable Architecture**: Processes 3-10 documents within 60-second constraint
- **Rich Output Format**: Provides structured JSON with metadata, ranked sections, and detailed analysis
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for fast analysis with comprehensive logging

### Validation & Testing

The solution has been tested with multiple scenarios including academic research, business analysis, educational content, and menu planning tasks. Performance consistently meets the <60 second processing constraint while maintaining high relevance accuracy for persona-specific document analysis.

This approach ensures that users receive the most pertinent information from large document collections, tailored specifically to their role and objectives.
